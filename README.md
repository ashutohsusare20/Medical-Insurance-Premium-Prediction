## :innocent:Motivation

To select the best Health plan, and to predict premium have been never that much simple.I used to wonder how Insurance amount is charged normally. So, I have decided to and came across this dataset and start working on it. By using this I know that how users provided information determine our insurance premium.

## :dart:Aim 

Design the Model, which predict the medical insurance premium.
